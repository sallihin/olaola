# olaola music player
A music app for kids, built with Java on Android Studios. "Ola Ola" is a filler word that my 3 year old daughter uses when she's unsure what to say. I didn't know what to call my app, so let's call it "Ola Ola". Ola coincidentally means wave in Spanish. Like sound waves! ðŸ’¡

## Tasks / Features

## Proposed GUI 
I designed the app on Adobe XD. The initial design contains additional functions which was later not included due to time constraints.

## Bugs Found
- [x] Tapping on the coverArt multiple times causes startActivity animation to appear 
- [ ] When going prevActivity from the player, the current screen blinks for a second
- [ ] Pressing next/previous, the current coverArt disappears instead of slides out
