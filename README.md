# olaola music player
A music app for kids, built with Java on Android Studios. "Ola Ola" is a filler word that my 3 year old daughter uses when she's unsure what to say. I didn't know what to call my app, so let's call it "Ola Ola". Ola coincidentally means wave in Spanish. Like sound waves! ðŸ’¡

## Tasks / Features
- [x] Proposed GUI on XD
- [x] App Login via Firebase Authentication
- [x] Store/Retrieve data from Firebase Realtime Database
- [x] Slide transitions 
- [x] Swipe left/right to change music 
- [x] Scrub songs 
- [x] Replay music
- [x] Shuffle music 
- [x] Swipe to change songs 
- [x] Store additional user details on Firebase 
- [x] Display unique user name on Song Listing Activity


## Notes
- The uneven songlist was done intentionally to display the dynamics of the 2 column layout.
- Swipe left/right on the player screen to change songs
- Swipe down on the player screen to go back to the song list 


## Proposed GUI 
I designed the app on Adobe XD. The initial design contains additional functions which was later not included due to time constraints.

## Bugs Found
- [x] Tapping on the coverArt multiple times causes startActivity animation to appear 
- [ ] When going prevActivity from the player, the current screen blinks for a second
- [ ] Pressing next/previous, the current coverArt disappears instead of slides out
- [ ] Sometimes the shuffle song lands on the same song again
